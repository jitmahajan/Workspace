      Dear diary, Today I went to Pune railway station, to receive my uncle and
      aunt who were coming from Mumbai. It was a bright sunny day. Sun was
      shining like a star. While I and my father were crossing the Central mall,
      we saw three elephants that made me reminded of my Kerala trip.

      Last year I went on a Kerala trip, where we visited around 5 cities like
      Cochin, Wayanad, Munnar, Kovalam, and Alappuzha. All the places were
      really awesome and beautiful. Then we went to Elephant junction Thekkady,
      Kumily, where people go for elephant rides. I rode sitting above the
      elephant around for 2 and half hours. Then we have also done elephant bath
      and feeding. We took a lot of pictures with elephants. It was a nice trip
      and I still cannot get over it.

      I want to explore more places like this from India and also outside of
      India. And click pictures to add in my collection. I wish my dream come
      true before i die.
